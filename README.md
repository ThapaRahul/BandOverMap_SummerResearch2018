# BandOverMap_SummerResearch2018

This is one of the main project I did over the summer of 2018 at Villanova University under the guidance of Dr. David Chuss, a physicw professor at Villanova University. In this project, I created a color spectrum for the Orion Nebula such that the range of color represent the ratio of intensity of Band E over band D data taken from HAWC+ camera administered by Villanova University.  

Our group at Villanova was part of the instrument team for the HAWC+ camera that operates on NASAâ€™s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a 2.5 meter telescope mounted inside a Boeing 747 that observes the infrared sky at an altitude of 45,000 feet. HAWC+ is now collecting data from regions of our Galaxy where stars are forming, and we are working to use these data to understand why stars are formed at such an unexpectedly low rate in the Milky way. HAWC+ uses the polarization of infrared light to trace the pattern of magnetic fields in the large clouds of gas and dust from which stars form. We can use this information to determine whether magnetic fields are responsible for slowing the rate of star formation.

Orion nebula is one of the most studied nebula in Astronomy and physics. If you want to learn more about the nebula, follow the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula.

I used Python's package such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and APLpy to model the image and plotted magnetic field vectors over the map to show the direction of magnetic field in the region.
